## news

I initially tried to use unroll.me to focus and send relevant content to one giant newsletter. I eventually realized that there is in fact a limit of content that the human brain can consume effectively. I, therefore,
decided to go through all 144 newsletters, figure out which ones I actually use/care about, and move them to
something I could parse on the go.

I basically use [MailClark](https://mailclark.ai/) to pipe the following newsletters to slack as well as the
[FastVoted](https://fastvoted.com/) plugin.
